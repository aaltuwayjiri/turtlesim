# Manipulate turtlesim in ROS 2
the best way to manipulate turtlesim is by using (trq) a graphical user interface (GUI) for ROS that allows for easy interaction and visualization of ROS topics, services, and parameters. You can use rqt to manipulate various aspects of turtlesim, such as moving the turtle, changing its appearance, and altering the background color.


# Prerequisites
